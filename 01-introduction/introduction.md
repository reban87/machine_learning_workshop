## Introduction 

### 1. What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on building systems that can learn from data and improve over time without being explicitly programmed.

#### Key Points:
- **Definition**: ML enables computers to learn from data, identify patterns, and make predictions or decisions based on that data.
- **Core Idea**: It revolves around algorithms that improve their performance as they are exposed to more data.
- **Types of ML**: There are three main types:
  - **Supervised Learning**: Learning from labeled data to predict outcomes.
  - **Unsupervised Learning**: Learning from unlabeled data to identify hidden patterns.
  - **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning by interacting with the environment and receiving feedback.

### 2. ML vs Rule-Based Systems

Machine learning and rule-based systems are both approaches to making decisions or predictions, but they differ fundamentally.

#### Key Points:
- **Rule-Based Systems**:
  - Based on predefined rules created by human experts.
  - Performs well in deterministic environments with clear rules.
  - Limited scalability and adaptability when faced with complex, unseen data.
  
- **Machine Learning Systems**:
  - Can automatically learn from data and improve over time.
  - More flexible, especially in situations where rules are hard to define or change dynamically.
  - Suitable for handling large datasets with complex patterns.

### 3. ML vs Deep Learning (DL)

While **Machine Learning** (ML) and **Deep Learning** (DL) both fall under the broader category of artificial intelligence, they are distinct from one another in various ways.

#### Key Points:
- **Machine Learning (ML)**:
  - ML involves algorithms that learn from data and improve their performance over time.
  - Typically requires feature engineering (manually selecting relevant features from data).
  - ML models are often simpler and require less computational power than deep learning models.
  - Algorithms: Linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines (SVM), etc.

- **Deep Learning (DL)**:
  - DL is a subfield of ML that uses artificial neural networks with many layers (hence the term "deep").
  - DL can automatically learn features from raw data, reducing or eliminating the need for feature engineering.
  - Requires large amounts of labeled data and significant computational resources (especially GPUs).
  - Common in areas like image recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and speech recognition.
  - Algorithms: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Transformer models, etc.

### 4. Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained using labeled data to make predictions or classifications.

#### Key Points:
- **Training with Labeled Data**: The model learns from input-output pairs (features and their corresponding labels).
- **Objective**: The goal is to predict the correct output for new, unseen data.
- **Common Algorithms**:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Neural Networks
  
- **Applications**:
  - Image classification
  - Spam email detection
  - Predictive maintenance

### 5. Model Selection for Machine Learning

Selecting the right machine learning model is crucial to achieving the best performance on a given task.

#### Key Points:
- **Understanding the Problem**: Identify whether the task is classification, regression, clustering, etc.
- **Data Availability**: Consider the quantity and quality of data. Some models require large datasets, while others may work with limited data.
- **Model Complexity**: Simpler models may underfit (too simple to capture patterns), while more complex models may overfit (too sensitive to noise in the data).
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Use appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) to evaluate model performance.
- **Cross-validation**: Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well.

#### Template

- Split datasets in training, validation, and test. E.g. 60%, 20% and   20% respectively
- Train the models
- Evaluate the models
- Select the best model
- Apply the best model to the test dataset
- Compare the performance metrics of validation and test

### 6. Machine Learning Libraries

Various libraries in Python make implementing machine learning models efficient and accessible.

#### Key Points:
- **NumPy**:
  - Fundamental library for numerical computations in Python.
  - Provides support for arrays and matrices and a wide range of mathematical functions.
  - Useful for handling large datasets and performing mathematical operations efficiently.

- **Pandas**:
  - Library for data manipulation and analysis.
  - Provides easy-to-use data structures (like DataFrames) for handling structured data.
  - Excellent for data cleaning, preparation, and exploratory analysis.

- **Other Libraries**:
  - **Scikit-learn**: A versatile library for classical machine learning algorithms.
  - **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch**: Libraries for deep learning and neural networks.
  - **Keras**: A high-level neural networks API, running on top of TensorFlow.
